# Vision-Bridge
**Mobility in everyday surroundings remains a significant challenge for visually impaired individuals, as conventional aids like walking sticks and human guidance offer limited real-time environmental feedback. Current assistive technologies are often hindered by constrained sensor capabilities, reducing accessibility for those who need them most.
VisionBridge addresses these limitations through an AI-based assistive system designed to enhance mobility and object identification for the visually impaired. The system utilizes camera modules to capture real-time visual information. This data is processed using the .HEF model deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5 equipped with a Hailo-8L TPU, enabling efficient identification of obstacles, objects, and environmental features.
By leveraging the Raspberry Pi 5's PCIe interface with the Hailo-8L accelerator, the system achieves real-time inference with minimal latency, creating a portable, standalone solution that provides timely audio feedback about environmental obstacles. This hardware configuration transforms theoretical computer vision capability into practical assistance for daily navigation. VisionBridge demonstrates that combining affordable embedded hardware with optimized AI models can significantly enhance independence and safety for visually impaired individuals.
